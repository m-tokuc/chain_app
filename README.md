Chain is a productivity app that reimagines the "Break the Chain" method for groups. Teams of 3-5 people set a daily goal. Everyone must complete that day's task for the chain to progress. If a member skips, the chain resets. This social accountability mechanic aims to increase your team's motivation and cohesion.
